Building the GRiD 1520 BIOS
---------------------------

The build process assumes an environment environment that run the Linux
version of the EuroASM assembler (euroasm.x).  Development is normally
done with a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) Debian setup.

One-time setup:

 * sudo apt-get install perl cpanminus makepp srecord unzip
 * sudo cpanm Carton
 * cd src-glink; carton install --deployment; cd ..

For each build, execute "makepp" from the top-level directory.
This will:

 * Setup EuroASM
   * Extract EuroASM from its distribution archive.
   * Patch EuroASM so it can assemble source from symbolic links as well
     as ordinary files.
   * Assemble and link EuroASM into the tools/ directory.
 * For each supported version of the BIOS, it will:
   * Use makepp's repository feature to link required source files into
     the appropriate build/bios-*/ directory.
   * Use EuroASM to assemble the .asm files into OMF .obj files.
   * Use the Perl script in src-glink to link the .obj files into a BIOS image.
   * Converts the binary image into an Intel HEX text file.
   * Compares the HEX file to the original BIOS HEX file, reporting the number
     of mismatched lines.

The output files are (for each version of the BIOS, in build/bios-*/):

 * bios.bin		- Binary BIOS image.
 * bios.hex		- Intel HEX version of BIOS image.
 * bios.map		- Listing of symbols and their final addresses in the
                          built image.
 * *.asm.lst		- Assembler listing for individual modules.
 * original-bios.bin	- Binary image of original BIOS, dumped from GRiD
			  hardware.
* original-bios.hex	- Intel HEX version of original BIOS image.
