Building the GRiD 1520 BIOS
---------------------------

The build process assumes a Linux environment that can also run the
euroasm.exe assembler.  This might be possible with Wine, but development
is normally done with a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) Debian setup.

One-time setup:

 * sudo apt-get perl cpanminus makepp srecord unzip
 * sudo cpanm Carton
 * cd src-glink; carton install --deployment; cd ..

For each build, execute "makepp" from the top-level directory.
This will:

 * Extract EuroASM from its distribution archive.
 * Use EuroASM to assemble .asm files into OMF .obj files in the src/build directory.
 * Use the Perl script in src-glink to link the .obj files into a BIOS image.
 * Converts the binary image into an Intel HEX text file.
 * Compares the HEX file to the original BIOS HEX file, reporting the number of mismatched lines.

The output files are:

 * src/build/bios.bin	- Binary BIOS image.
 * src/build/bios.map	- Listing of symbols and their final addresses in the built image.
 * src/build/*.asm.lst	- Assembler listing for individual modules.
