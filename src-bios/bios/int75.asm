; Interrupt handler for co-processor error state [TechRef 2-5]
; When the coprocessor detects an error condition it generates an error
; signal.  Support circuitry converts this to an int75h with the
; coprocessor BUSY flag set.  This procedure takes care of converting
; this 80287-specific error state into a call to the int2h NMI handler,
; as the original PC BIOS would have had to deal with.
