PROJECT ORGANISATION
====================

build/
	Output directory for built ROM image (.bin and .hex).

euroasm/
	Extracted contents of the EuroAssembler ZIP file.
	The EuroAssembler license permits distribution only as an
	unmodified ZIP file, so we extract the contents at build time.

original-roms/
	Images dumped from actual GRiD 1520 ROM chips.

src/
	Source code for the 1520 BIOS.

src/build/
	Output directory for .obj files.

src/post/
	Source code for the power-on self-test portion of the BIOS.

src/segments
	Data layout definitions for the PC's interrupt vector table and
	the BIOS data area.

src-glink/
	Perl code implementing a minimal linker that takes 16-bit OMF
	files and input and links them into a binary ROM image.

src-scripts/
	Random Perl scripts that aren't part of the main BIOS build.

NAMING AND NAMES
================

With a few exceptions, procedure names are restricted to 15 characters
so that they will not cause code to be unnecessarily indented (assuming
a two-tab indent).  There are a few common prefixes that are used to
group procedures by subsystem:

Prefix		Subsystem
-----------------------------------------------------------
A20		Address line 20 control
Cmos		Nonvolatile memory in the RTC chip
Con		Console output to the screen
Fd		Floppy disk controller
Grid		GRiD-specific features
Hd		Hard drive, not specific to AT/XT types
HdAt		AT ("compatible") hard drive
HdXt		XT ("non-compatible") hard drive
Int		Interrupt handler
Kb		PS/2 keyboard
Par		Parallel ports
Pm		Protected-mode
POST		Power-on self-test
Pw		GRiD BIOS boot password
Rtc		Date/time/alarm in the RTC chip
SDH		Shutdown handlers for recovering from reset
Ser		Serial ports
Sys		Int15 interrupt handlers
Test		Hardware functinoality tests
Vid		Video functions
VidGrap		Graphical mode video functions
VidInit		Video controller initialisation
