GRiD BIOS 1988-09-12
====================

The 1988-09-12 version of the GRiD 1520 BIOS has these differences
compared to the 1989-03-11 version:

 * Default handlers for IRQs IntA (cascade)IntF (unused), and Int77 (?)
   immediately return with an IRET and do not acknowledge the IRQ on
   either PIC.

 * Includes the GRiD BIOS copyright notice immediately after the
   Phoenix BIOS copyright notice in ROM, instead of printing it out
   on-screen.

 * Does not support the GRiD-specific boot password feature.
   This also means that:
    * CMOS_GRIDFLAGS only supports setting the lowest bit and does not
      preserve any higher ones.
    * Int 15/E4 doesn't support undocumented subfunction 4A.

 * No support for GRiD drive backplane type nine (GRID_HD_9).

 * IDE auto-detect only supports Connor hard drive models CP3022,
   CP344, and CP3104.  No support for models CP3024, CP3044, or
   CP3042 as in later BIOSes.

 * For some reason has the last entry in the BackplFdTypes array set
   to be a 3.5" 1.44MB floppy drive instead of no floppy drives.
   Odd because I don't think those array entries are ever referenced.

 * Lacks the call to HdWaitSpinUp before initializing a built-in
   plasma display.  Possibly this could lead to excessive draw on the
   power supply as the drive and display both pull max inrush current.

 * Has a simpler (shorter) attempt to reset built-in modem on reboot.

 * Doesn't support auto-detecting 256KB/1MB memory controller chip.
   I think this means it only supports the 256KB variant?

 * Only supports auto-detecting two serial ports.
